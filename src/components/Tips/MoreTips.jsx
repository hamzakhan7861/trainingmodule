                The genetic findings in the myDNA personalised diet report give
                you an insight into how your body may be pre-programmed when it
                comes to weight management and lipid levels. We donâ€™t currently
                test for food intolerances, allergies or medical conditions.
                Please note if you have any specific medical conditions, or are
                pregnant or breastfeeding it is recommended to discuss any plans
                for a new diet or exercise program with your health

                A strict quality assurance process combined with state of the
                art laboratory facilities, allows us to control reliability and
                validity of our tests. Our reports and findings are developed in
                accordance to internationally recognised guidelines and factor
                in a large number of published studies.

                <br />
                We do not test for disease risk or cancer genomics and have no
                plans to do so in the future. As a result our tests should not
                have relevance for life insurance policies
